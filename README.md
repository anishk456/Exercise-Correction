<h1>Exercise Correction</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, MediaPipe's pose estimation model is effectively utilized to enhance the form of a bicep curl. The project systematically extracts and processes six essential joint points from the estimated pose to aid in the evaluation of curling form. An algorithm developed in Python is employed to calculate and assess joint angles while also keeping track of the count for repetitions with good form.
